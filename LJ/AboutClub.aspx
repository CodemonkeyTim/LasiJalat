               <h2>The history of Swamp Soccer</h2>
                <p>The forefather of swamp soccer is known as Esa Romppainen, Vuokatti Ski Team's skier from Hyrynsalmi who wanted to intensify his summertime training using the swamp.</p><br/>
                <p>The notion of swamp soccer was brought up, and mad brainstorming ensued to consider the possibilities for the sport to become a success. The concept blew the council decision-makers off their feet, and the first competition was organised with a great deal of effort from volunteers in the summer of 1998. The very first Finnish Championships saw 13 teams participate.</p><br/>
                <p>There was soon an explosion in competition appeal, and already the following year saw four times as many teams competing in the tournament. The last competition of the millennium was the European Championships with 57 teams.</p><br/>
                <p>Swamp soccer has been played as a World Championship since 2000 and the number of participants has increased each year. Over the decade, 250 – 300 competition, novice, women’s and business series teams have become established with players from Finland, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Sweden, Russia, Scotland and Iceland.</p><br/>
                <p>Swamp visitors, including spectators, moving around the area during the event weekend total at best 30,000. This helps to create a unique atmosphere around the event that even fascinates those not interested in the sport.</p>
              
              <h2>The history ofSnow Soccer</h2>
                 <p>The frozen Lake Syväjärvi has been used as a wintertime snow soccer match arena since 2000, when the very first snow soccer tournament was played. Back then, the weekend carried the banner of Finnish Championships and saw participation by only 17 teams.</p><br/>
                    <p>Already the following year the competition achieved European Championship status, and since 2002 Ukkohalla has been the venue for the battle for the World Championship title with 40 men’s and 10 women’s teams. The 2007 World Championships were the sixth in the history of the insanely fun sport.</p>
